## Oh Hi There 👋

I've been an Electrical Engineer for over 7 year. Tired of the lack of passion in the profession and community around it, I started the exausting but very fulfilling path of the career transition into Data Engineer and it worked! Now I'm a full fledged Data Engineer with, if you may ask, some pretty nice projects and certifications! You can checkout my links below:
